# Task-6-cyber-security-internship
Introduction to Cryptography

## Overview
This task focuses on understanding the fundamentals of cryptography and performing basic cryptographic operations such as encryption, hashing, and digital signatures using free tools.

## Objective
- Understand symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Perform AES encryption
- Learn hashing and integrity verification
- Understand digital signatures
- Gain real-world cryptography knowledge

##  Tools Used
- CyberChef (AES Encryption)
- OpenSSL (conceptual understanding)

## Experiments Performed

### 1. AES Encryption (Symmetric Encryption)
- Algorithm: AES
- Mode: CBC
- Key Size: 128-bit
- Tool: CyberChef
- Result: Plaintext successfully encrypted into hexadecimal ciphertext

### 2. Hashing
- Algorithm: SHA-256
- Purpose: Integrity verification
- Observation: Hash value changes when file content changes

### 3. Digital Signature (Concept)
- Uses asymmetric cryptography
- Ensures authenticity and integrity of data


##  Outcome
This task helped in building strong fundamentals of cryptography, including encryption, hashing, and security concepts.

##  Key Learning
AES requires fixed-length keys (128/192/256 bits). Incorrect key size results in encryption failure.
